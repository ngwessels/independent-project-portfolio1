          <h3 class="educationinfo">For four years of my life I went to a High School in Beaverton Oregon, known as Jesuit High School. Jesuit is a private catholic high school of about 1000 teens. Jesuit is known for many things, its athletic department, and its education system. But one thing that I always participated in was technical theatre.
          <h3 class="educationinfo">I graduated High School in June of 2017. Since than I have been going to Portland Community College the Rock Creek Campus for the past 1 1/2 years.

          <h3 class="educationinfo">I took a couple computer science classes in the last year. I took a little c++ and a little python. In the past 1 1/2 years I have gotten most my pre-requisites done and when done with Epicodus I plan to go to a 4-year college!</h3>
